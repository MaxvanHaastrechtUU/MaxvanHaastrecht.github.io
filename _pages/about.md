Read about my publications, teaching, talks, and more. For more information on my research, see my [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/MANHaastrecht) page and the website of the [GEIGER project](https://project.cyber-geiger.eu/).

My work is what I do, but it doesn't always reflect who I am. Michel de Montaigne once said: *I quote others only in order the better to express myself.* So, to give you some sense of what I find interesting and important, here are some quotes by others that express who I am:
  
***Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.*** - *C.S. Lewis*
  
***Opportunities multiply as they are seized.*** - *Sun Tzu*

***For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.*** - *Richard Feynman*
  
***A mind is like a parachute, it does not work if it is not open.*** - *Frank Zappa*
  
***Do not judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.*** - *Robert Louis Stevenson*

And, last but not least, not a quote but a video. A commencement address by Steve Jobs at Stanford, the most inspiring speech I have ever seen:
