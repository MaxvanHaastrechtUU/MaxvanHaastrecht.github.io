###### A BSc [course](https://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak/INFOB3INSE) for Information Science students taught by dr. Fabiano Dalpiaz. Students learn about basic security principles such as the CIA triad and the vulnerability-threat-control paradigm. Additionally, we dive deep into security requirements using STS-ml. This year we introduced a privacy component based on the [LINDDUN](https://www.linddun.org/) privacy threat framework, which we introduced to the students using the fun LINDDUN GO game.
